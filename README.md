System Requirement
---------------------------

- JDK 7
- Postgresql 9
- Git
- Gradle 2.3
  #### For Linux users
   * Download the source binary directly from the gradle website.
   * Copy the downloaded folder to /usr/bin. 
   * Add the path to gradle bin folder to your /etc/profile file
   
   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/gradle-2.3/bin"
   
  #### For Mac users
   * Install HomeBrew
   * Run ```brew install gradle```         

- Node.js

  #### For Linux users
   * Install Nodejs as described [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#rhelcentosscientific-linux-6) based on your Linux flavour.

  #### For Mac users
  * Install Node.js [directly](http://nodejs.org/) or using homebrew using `brew install nodejs`
  * Those who install Node.js using Homebrew should export the following (or include in ```$HOME/.bash_profile``` or ```$HOME/.profile``` or ```$HOME/.bashrc``` or ```$HOME/.zshrc```, depending on your shell.
      - **export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node"**
      - **export PATH="/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH"**  
  
- NPM dependencies (used for linting JS, LESS files, minifying JS files & running jasmine specs etc.)
  * Install Grunt command-line runner by running (after installing Node.js as mentioned in aformentioned step) ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
  * Install project-specific grunt dependencies by navigating to ```modules/openlmis-web``` from project root directory and run ```npm install``` (one-time activity)
  * Install karma test runner with karma coverage by running ```npm install -g karma karma-coverage```
  * Grunt tasks available can be found in ```modules/openlmis-web/Gruntfile.js``` 

Source code 
------------------
 1. Get the source code using ``git clone https://github.com/USAID-DELIVER-PROJECT/elmis.git``
 2. Also resolve dependencies on submodule using command ``git submodule init`` and then ``git submodule update``
 


IntelliJ IDEA Setup
-------------------
1. Run ```gradle idea``` to create the IntelliJ project files (may take some time downloading dependencies)
2. Open the open-lmis.ipr file (may take some time indexing files, first time only)
3. Install Lombok plugin according to the IntelliJ version.

 
Running App on embedded Jetty server
--------------------------------------------------
1. Clone the project repository using git.
3. Setup _postgres_ user with password as configured in _gradle.properties_ file.

3. You can use ```gradle clean setupdb setupExtensions seed build testseed run``` to start the app.
 
 There are bunch of gradle tasks that you can see by running ```gradle tasks```

 - ```build``` is to build the app.
 - ```setupdb``` is to recreate the database and schema.
 - ```setupExtensions``` is to apply the database schema extensions added.
 - ```seed``` is to seed in the reference data.
 - ```testseed``` puts in some test data which can be used to browse through basic functionality in the system.
 - ```run``` is to start the embedded jetty server.

Once run, you can access the home page at http://localhost:9091/

**Note:** You may encounter a ```java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space```. This is a result of not enough memory for
the Jetty JVM. One way to fix this is to export the following (or include in ```$HOME/.bash_profile``` or
```$HOME/.profile``` or ```$HOME/.bashrc``` or ```$HOME/.zshrc```, depending on your shell.)

 - **export JAVA_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=512m"**
 - **export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xms512m"**
